    <div class="wholegrpabout">
        <p>NCT Dream debuted under SM Entertainment as the third sub-unit of boy-group NCT on August 25, 2016, as a 7-member group consisting of
        Mark, Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle and Jisung. </p>
        <p>The group debuted as 7 with Chewing Gum but member Jaemin went on hiatus in 2017 before the group's second album release
            due to a back injury. He joined back in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>The group previously had a graduation system where members who reach the age of 20 (korean age) would "graduate" from the group,
            under which Mark was removed from the group. However, the system was removed in 2020 and Mark was added back into the group's lineup.
